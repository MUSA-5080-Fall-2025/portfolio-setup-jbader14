Even though these fall within high confidence, we should still proceed with caution when using this data for algorithmic decision-making. A pattern amongst the top highest MOE % revealed that all five counties make up the most southern counties in New Jersey.\nFor Cape May and Atlantic counties, a potential cause for higher MOE % stems from their economies being highly reliant on tourism for many residents. Especially, when you consider their location at the Jersey Shore, the flow of tourists is highly dependent on the season (notably, Summer), which can lead to further uncertainty in income reporting.\nCumberland, Salem, and Atlantic counties represent the three lowest counties in median income from this data. It may be the case that these counties may exhibit larger margins of error due to more residents working lower paying, hourly jobs that skew the reporting of median income, leading to higher MOE %."

As stated previously, Cape May has a high MOE %, relative to the rest of NJ, due to its tourist driven economy and volatility in income during a calendar year. Essex county has a moderately low MOE % and median income, revealing that lower income communities may not always have higher MOE %. Although, Essex could be an outlier."

There are a few reasons why we observe this. For one, tracts are much smaller than counties and when we have a smaller sample size, this can lead to more variation, hence less reliability (higher margins of error throughout the data). Secondly, since we set our MOE indicator to be classified as “High MOE” if one or more demographic had a higher MOE than 10%. As a result, this design decision leads to more tracts being categorized as “High MOE” than if we made a stricter boundary of all three demographics must have a higher MOE than 10%. Lastly, the tract data was much sparser than the county level data with many demographic estimates and margins being zero for certain tracks, which could possibly be a reporting error.\nFrom the clear imbalance of our high and low MOE classes for the tracts in our selected counties, we should approach drawing conclusions about demographics and reliability with caution. Nevertheless, it seems that our six “Low MOE” tracts are much less diverse and predominantly White (88.89% compared to 42.21%). It is possible that these communities may have better access to reporting their statistics or are potentially more well informed about the Census and obligation to report. But, it is important to question the oddity that there average Black population is 0% across these tracts. This leads me to believe that this is due to the sparsity issue in the data itself. If the data showed that there are no Black residents (and very little Hispanic residents), then these tracts theoretically would only have to worry about passing the MOE threshold for the White demographic. It is important to consider all possibilities when trying to analyze and uncover patterns within data."

    "text": "5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\nYour Task: Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\nExecutive Summary Requirements:\n\nOverall Pattern Identification: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\nEquity Assessment: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\nRoot Cause Analysis: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\nStrategic Recommendations: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\nExecutive Summary:\nOverall Pattern Identification: Three significant systematic patterns arose across our analyses. The first pattern was that there was a drastic decline in data reliability when moving from county to tract-level data. In our county analysis, all counties were classified as “high confidence” in MOE % for median income data. However, in our tract data for selected counties, less than 2% of tracts were classified as “high confidence” for demographic data. The second pattern came from our tract-level analysis where we saw that more diverse tracts were much less reliable in terms of collective demographic MOE %. The small percentage of “high confidence” tracts were predominantly white (88.89% compared to 42.21%). The third trend was revealed in geographic location in county analysis. Specifically, the highest MOE % of income data mainly resided in South Jersey, revealing clusters of uncertainty among these counties.\nEquity Assessment: Diverse communities with higher population percentages of people of color (Black, Hispanic) are most at risk of algorithmic biases. In our tract-level analysis, we saw more confident aggregate results among communities that were predominantly White rather than diverse. In addition, a majority of the missing data in these tracts came from the Black and Hispanic population estimates and margins. These discrepancies could cause further inequity in these diverse communities when using this tract-level data without caution in our algorithmic decision-making.\nRoot Cause Analysis:\n\nCounties with more variable income flow such as Cape May or Atlantic are likely to have less reliable survey responses, possibly skewing our data depending on when they are surveyed. For example, imagine an ice cream salesman at the Beach is asked about his income in July vs. December.\nThe effect of a smaller sample size in our tract data compared to county data is the main cause of less reliability in our MOE estimates. Smaller sample sizes leads to fewer survey responses, which leads to greater variability causing more uncertainty.\nThe effect of sparse or missing data at the tract-level is another potential cause for biased estimates in the reliability of our tract analysis. Since most of the “low MOE” tracts had missing demographic data for either the Black or Hispanic demographics, this made it easier for these tracts to pass our threshold test.\n\nStrategic Recommendations:\n\nReliability Thresholds: We should establish more realistic reliability thresholds at both the county and tract level. It is evident that our current decision boundary is not insightful with all counties having high reliability and 98% of tracts having low reliability. We should tighten the threshold for county data in New Jersey. For tract data, it would be valuable to split up reliability by race rather than testing if at least one race fails the threshold. It is also important to highlight which counties have missing data and exclude them from this analysis or state their omission.\nImproved Efforts in Surveying Diverse Tracts & Country Clusters: We saw that diverse tracts had less reliability than predominantly White tracts. Policymakers should make a stronger effort at reaching these communities to ensure that we are obtaining accurate data to prevent drawing biased conclusions about these demographic groups without proper representation. Additionally, we saw that there were clusters of counties that showed higher uncertainty than the rest of the state. It would be beneficial to address these clusters by promoting survey participation to aid policymakers.\nHigher Frequency Monitoring: For immediate policy considerations, it would be helpful to have more frequent data collection such as every three months or even every month if possible. This would be very beneficial to counties like Cape May or Atlantic but others as well. It would identify problems in communities much faster and allow for more actionable, targeted intervention in policy making."

They all have MOE less than our 5% threshold, making them high confidence for algorithmic decision making. However, if we wanted to examine tracts in individual counties, based on our tract-level analysis of three NJ counties, our data is much less reliable to use. Therefore, we should proceed with more caution for any kind of tract-level algorithmic implementation.\nCounties requiring additional oversight: No counties were classified as moderate confidence in NJ. However, I would say that counties near the bound of the 5% threshold like Cape May and Salem could be more closely monitored given their relatively high MOE above 4%. Additionally, as expressed earlier, counties such as Cape May and Atlantic that are highly reliant on tourism in generating income for its residents could use some supplementary data collection for analysis. Since income flow is extremely time-dependent, we should look to monitor the changes in income related to each season (or month) to get a better understanding of the income data. This would lead to more consistent comparisons across years through potential time-series modelling methods like a seasonal ARIMA model or something similar.\nCounties needing alternative approaches: No counties were classified as low confidence in NJ, so no specific alternatives are needed. However, it may be worthwhile to monitor the percent change in some of the higher MOE counties if they were to exhibit drastic increases in MOE % in future years. As mentioned previously, tract data within each county are much less reliable and could definitely benefit from precautionary measures such as manual data validation or increased data collection through additional surveys to give analysts more confidence in deriving algorithms to address issues at this level."

Instead of setting an arbitrary threshold value like $50,000, this method will flag the lowest 10% of median incomes as vulnerable.\nSimilarly, the elderly population threshold is set to identify vulnerable tracts for all tracts that fall at or above the 90th percentile of elderly populations. The tracts the highest 10% of elderly population percentages are flagged as vulnerable. We chose to use elderly population percentages over raw estimates to normalize for total tract populations.\n659 tracts are classified as vulnerable, meaning they are either vulnerable by a low median income or high elderly population, which accounts for 25.87% of tracts. After testing different thresholds such as 25th income / 75th elderly population percentiles and using “and”, meaning both conditions must be true. I opted to make both thresholds stricter but use “or”, only one condition must be true. Ultimately, this decision led to more insightful results when analyzing underserved tracts with respect to vulnerable ones, which was conducted later in my analysis.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\n\n\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital\n\n# Get centroids of each tract (POINT)\ncentroids &lt;- st_centroid(pa_tract_flagged) \n\n# Transform to US Albers Equal Area CRS\ncentroids &lt;- st_transform(centroids, 5070)\nhospitals &lt;- st_transform(hospitals, 5070)\n\n# Create distance matrix between centroids & hospitals\ndistance_matrix &lt;- st_distance(centroids, hospitals)\n\n# Find closest hospital to each centroid\nmin_dist &lt;- apply(distance_matrix, 1, min)\n\n# Create new df with feature for distance to nearest hospital\npa_tract_flagged &lt;- pa_tract_flagged |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    # Convert nearest diff to miles\n    dist_to_near_hosp = round(as.numeric(min_dist) * 0.000621371192, 2)\n  )\n\npa_tract_vuln &lt;- pa_tract_flagged |&gt;\n  # Filter for only vulnerable tracts\n  filter(vulnerable)\n\nRequirements: - Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania - Calculate distances in miles\n\n# What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts?\navg_dist_to_hosp &lt;- round(mean(pa_tract_vuln$dist_to_near_hosp, na.rm = TRUE), 2)\n\n# What is the maximum distance?\nmax_dist_to_hosp &lt;- max(pa_tract_vuln$dist_to_near_hosp, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# How many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital?\ncount_tracts_far_from_hosp &lt;- sum(pa_tract_vuln$dist_to_near_hosp &gt; 15, na.rm = TRUE)\n\nAnalysis:\n\nWe are using the US Albers Equal Area projection because it preserves areas and distances without much distortion like the Web Mercator projection. It also has been proven to be effective to use with demographic and statistical analysis in the United States, making it a strong choice for this work.\nAnong vulnerable tracts, the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts is 3.6 miles, and the maximum distance is 28.98 miles.\nThere are 19 vulnerable tracts whose nearest hospital is greater than 15 miles away. These tracts are categorized as underserved in step 5.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Identify Underserved Areas\nDefine “underserved” as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\n\n# Create underserved variable\npa_tract_flagged &lt;- pa_tract_flagged |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    underserved = case_when((dist_to_near_hosp &gt; 15 & vulnerable == TRUE) ~ TRUE)\n  ) \n\n\n# Count number of underserved tracts\ncount_underserved &lt;- round(sum(pa_tract_flagged$underserved == TRUE, na.rm = TRUE), 2)\n\n# What percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?\npercent_underserved &lt;- round(100 * count_tracts_far_from_hosp / count_vuln, 2)\n\nAnalysis:\n\nAs discussed previously, there are 19 underserved tracts. 2.88% of vulnerable tracts are classified as underserved. This metric seems somewhat surprisingly low to me. It would make sense that vulnerable tracts with lower median incomes would have worse access to hospitals than this. However, we must remember that some vulnerable tracts are classified only by high elderly population percentages. Intuitively, these tracts should have more hospitals nearby since elderly populations would most likely need access to more hospital resources and services than younger populations. Since these two effects inversely relate to one another, it makes some sense why only a small percentage of vulnerable tracts are classified as underserved; however, the metric still seems low to me. In a future analysis, it could be worthwhile to experiment with a lower threshold for distance to nearest hospital to get more concrete results of underserved tracts in PA.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Aggregate to County Level\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n# Transform CRS\npa_tract_flagged &lt;- st_transform(pa_tract_flagged, 5070)\npa_county_bounds &lt;- st_transform(pa_county_bounds, 5070)\n\ncounty_level_stats &lt;- pa_tract_flagged |&gt;\n  # Spatial join tracts to counties\n  st_join(pa_county_bounds) |&gt;\n  # Drop geom\n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt;\n  # Group by county\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAM) |&gt;\n  # Aggregate statistics by county\n  summarize(\n    # Number of vulnerable tracts\n    n_vuln_tracts = sum(vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE),\n    # Underserved total pop\n    total_under_pop = sum(total_popE[underserved], na.rm = TRUE),\n    # Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n    n_under_tracts = sum(underserved, na.rm = TRUE),\n    pct_under_of_vuln = round(dplyr::if_else(\n      n_vuln_tracts &gt; 0,\n      100 * n_under_tracts / n_vuln_tracts,\n      0), \n      2),\n    # Avg hospital distance for vulnerable tracts\n    avg_dist_vuln_hosp = round(mean(dist_to_near_hosp[vulnerable], na.rm = TRUE), 2),\n    # Total vulnerable population\n    total_vuln_pop = sum(total_popE[vulnerable], na.rm = TRUE)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n# county_level_stats - hidden from output\n\n\n# Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?\ntop5_counties_under &lt;- county_level_stats |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(pct_under_of_vuln)) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 5) |&gt;\n  select(COUNTY_NAM, n_vuln_tracts, n_under_tracts, pct_under_of_vuln)\n\n# top5_counties_under - hidden from output\n\n# Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?\n# Reminder: Underserved populations = vulnerable populations living far from hospitals\ntop5_under_pops &lt;- county_level_stats |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_under_pop)) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 10) |&gt;\n  select(COUNTY_NAM, total_under_pop)\n\n# top5_under_pops - hidden from output\n\nRequired county-level statistics:\n\nNumber of vulnerable tracts\nNumber of underserved tracts\nPercentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\nAverage distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\nTotal vulnerable population\n\nAnalysis:\n\nThe five counties with the highest percentage of underserved tracts among vulnerable tracts are Bradford, Cameron, Potter, Sullivan, and Tioga.\nThe counties with the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals are Pike, Bradford, Clearfield, Elk, and Chester.\nThere is a common theme that most underserved tracts with worse access to nearby hospitals come from more rural counties in North Central PA. This intuitively makes sense for a few reasons. Firstly, there are less hospitals in those counties. Secondly, the counties in this region of PA are geographically larger as well as the census tracts within them. The combination of less hospitals and larger census tract areas means there is less access to nearby hospitals (within the 15 mile threshold), leading to higher underserved populations. It is hard to distinguish patterns from tables alone; therefore, we will supplement this analysis with plots in future sections.\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Create Summary Table\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.\n\n# Create and format priority counties table\npriority_counties &lt;- county_level_stats |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_under_pop)) |&gt;\n  slice_head(n = 10) |&gt;\n  transmute(\n    County = COUNTY_NAM,\n    `Underserved Population` = comma(total_under_pop),\n    `Vulnerable tracts` = n_vuln_tracts,\n    `Underserved tracts` = n_under_tracts,\n    `% of Underserved Tracts` = percent(pct_under_of_vuln / 100, accuracy = 0.1),\n    `Avg distance to Hospital for Vulnerable Tracts` = number(avg_dist_vuln_hosp, accuracy = 0.01)\n  )\n  \n  \nkable(priority_counties, \n      caption = \"Top 10 Priority Counties for Healthcare Investment in PA\",\n      format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"))\n\n\nTop 10 Priority Counties for Healthcare Investment in PA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounty\nUnderserved Population\nVulnerable tracts\nUnderserved tracts\n% of Underserved Tracts\nAvg distance to Hospital for Vulnerable Tracts\n\n\n\n\nPIKE\n7,666\n12\n5\n41.7%\n15.90\n\n\nBRADFORD\n7,166\n2\n2\n100.0%\n18.35\n\n\nCLEARFIELD\n5,891\n4\n2\n50.0%\n12.75\n\n\nELK\n5,891\n3\n2\n66.7%\n12.89\n\n\nCHESTER\n5,626\n13\n1\n7.7%\n5.79\n\n\nCLINTON\n5,578\n4\n3\n75.0%\n15.51\n\n\nPOTTER\n5,578\n3\n3\n100.0%\n17.40\n\n\nLUZERNE\n4,905\n31\n3\n9.7%\n5.15\n\n\nCAMERON\n4,536\n2\n2\n100.0%\n18.93\n\n\nSULLIVAN\n3,860\n3\n3\n100.0%\n20.97\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements:\n\nUse knitr::kable() or similar for formatting\nInclude descriptive column names\nFormat numbers appropriately (commas for population, percentages, etc.)\nAdd an informative caption\nSort by priority (you decide the metric)"

The analysis portion should include some combination of spatial and attribute operations to answer a relatively straightforward question\n\n\nEducation & Youth Services\nOption A: Educational Desert Analysis - Data: Schools, Libraries, Recreation Centers, Census tracts (child population) - Question: “Which neighborhoods lack adequate educational infrastructure for children?” - Operations: Buffer schools/libraries (0.5 mile walking distance), identify coverage gaps, overlay with child population density - Policy relevance: School district planning, library placement, after-school program siting\nOption B: School Safety Zones - Data: Schools, Crime Incidents, Bike Network - Question: “Are school zones safe for walking/biking, or are they crime hotspots?” - Operations: Buffer schools (1000ft safety zone), spatial join with crime incidents, assess bike infrastructure coverage - Policy relevance: Safe Routes to School programs, crossing guard placement\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Justice\nOption C: Green Space Equity - Data: Parks, Street Trees, Census tracts (race/income demographics) - Question: “Do low-income and minority neighborhoods have equitable access to green space?” - Operations: Buffer parks (10-minute walk = 0.5 mile), calculate tree canopy or park acreage per capita, compare by demographics - Policy relevance: Climate resilience, environmental justice, urban forestry investment —\n\n\nPublic Safety & Justice\nOption D: Crime & Community Resources - Data: Crime Incidents, Recreation Centers, Libraries, Street Lights - Question: “Are high-crime areas underserved by community resources?” - Operations: Aggregate crime counts to census tracts or neighborhoods, count community resources per area, spatial correlation analysis - Policy relevance: Community investment, violence prevention strategies —\n\n\nInfrastructure & Services\nOption E: Polling Place Accessibility - Data: Polling Places, SEPTA stops, Census tracts (elderly population, disability rates) - Question: “Are polling places accessible for elderly and disabled voters?” - Operations: Buffer polling places and transit stops, identify vulnerable populations, find areas lacking access - Policy relevance: Voting rights, election infrastructure, ADA compliance\n\n\n\nHealth & Wellness\nOption F: Recreation & Population Health - Data: Recreation Centers, Playgrounds, Parks, Census tracts (demographics) - Question: “Is lack of recreation access associated with vulnerable populations?” - Operations: Calculate recreation facilities per capita by neighborhood, buffer facilities for walking access, overlay with demographic indicators - Policy relevance: Public health investment, recreation programming, obesity prevention\n\n\n\nEmergency Services\nOption G: EMS Response Coverage - Data: Fire Stations, EMS stations, Population density, High-rise buildings - Question: “Are population-dense areas adequately covered by emergency services?” - Operations: Create service area buffers (5-minute drive = ~2 miles), assess population coverage, identify gaps in high-density areas - Policy relevance: Emergency preparedness, station siting decisions\n\n\n\nArts & Culture\nOption H: Cultural Asset Distribution - Data: Public Art, Museums, Historic sites/markers, Neighborhoods - Question: “Do all neighborhoods have equitable access to cultural amenities?” - Operations: Count cultural assets per neighborhood, normalize by population, compare distribution across demographic groups - Policy relevance: Cultural equity, tourism, quality of life, neighborhood identity\n\n\n\n\nData Sources\nOpenDataPhilly: https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/ - Most datasets available as GeoJSON, Shapefile, or CSV with coordinates - Always check the Metadata for a data dictionary of the fields.\nAdditional Sources: - Pennsylvania Open Data: https://data.pa.gov/ - Census Bureau (via tidycensus): Demographics, economic indicators, commute patterns - TIGER/Line (via tigris): Geographic boundaries\n\n\nRecommended Starting Points\nIf you’re feeling confident: Choose an advanced challenge with multiple data layers. If you are a beginner, choose something more manageable that helps you understand the basics\nIf you have a different idea: Propose your own question! Just make sure: - You can access the spatial data - You can perform at least 2 spatial operations\n\n\nYour Analysis\n\nFind and load additional data\n\nDocument your data source\nCheck and standardize the CRS\nProvide basic summary statistics\n\n\n\n# Load crime, ppr sites, and street light datasets\ncrime &lt;- st_read(\"data/crime_incidents.shp\")\n\nReading layer `crime_incidents' from data source \n  `/Users/jack/Documents/GitHub/portfolio-setup-jbader14/assignments/assignment2/data/crime_incidents.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nreplacing null geometries with empty geometries\nSimple feature collection with 117984 features and 13 fields (with 4770 geometries empty)\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -75.27421 ymin: 5.684342e-14 xmax: 5.684342e-14 ymax: 40.13683\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\nppr_sites &lt;- st_read(\"data/PPR_Program_Sites.geojson\")\n\nReading layer `PPR_Program_Sites' from data source \n  `/Users/jack/Documents/GitHub/portfolio-setup-jbader14/assignments/assignment2/data/PPR_Program_Sites.geojson' \n  using driver `GeoJSON'\nSimple feature collection with 171 features and 10 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -75.2563 ymin: 39.90444 xmax: -74.96944 ymax: 40.12284\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\nlights &lt;- st_read(\"data/Street_Poles.geojson\")\n\nReading layer `Street_Poles' from data source \n  `/Users/jack/Documents/GitHub/portfolio-setup-jbader14/assignments/assignment2/data/Street_Poles.geojson' \n  using driver `GeoJSON'\nSimple feature collection with 202942 features and 16 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -75.28108 ymin: 39.87517 xmax: -74.95891 ymax: 40.13786\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\n\n# Transform CRS to EPSG: 2272 (South PA)\ncrime &lt;- st_transform(crime, 2272)\nppr_sites &lt;- st_transform(ppr_sites, 2272)\nlights &lt;- st_transform(lights, 2272)\n\n# Get Philadelphia tract data\nphl_tracts &lt;- get_acs(\n  geography = \"tract\",\n  variables = c(total_pop = \"B01003_001\"),\n  state = \"PA\",\n  county = \"Philadelphia\",\n  year = 2023,\n  survey = \"acs5\",\n  geometry = TRUE,\n  output = \"wide\",\n  cache_table = TRUE\n)\n\n# Transform CRS to EPSG: 2272\nphl_tracts &lt;- st_transform(phl_tracts, 2272)\n\n\n# Crime Summary Stats\n\ncrime &lt;- crime |&gt;\n  # Create a column for time of day\n  mutate(\n    time_of_day = case_when(\n      hour &gt;= 0  & hour &lt;= 5 ~ \"night\",\n      hour &gt;= 6  & hour &lt;=11 ~ \"morning\",\n      hour &gt;=12  & hour &lt;=17 ~ \"afternoon\",\n      TRUE                   ~ \"evening\"\n    )\n  )\n\n# Summary Stats: Type of Crime\ncrime_type &lt;- crime |&gt;\n  # Drop geometry\n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt;\n  # Group by type\n  group_by(text_gener) |&gt;\n  # Count each type of crime\n  summarize(count = n()) |&gt;\n  # Arrange by desc count\n  arrange(desc(count))\n\n# Summary Stats: Time of Day\ncrime_tod &lt;- crime |&gt;\n  # Drop geometry\n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt;\n  # Group by time of day\n  group_by(time_of_day) |&gt;\n  # Count crimes for each time of day\n  summarize(count = n()) |&gt;\n  # Arrange by desc count\n  arrange(desc(count))\n\n# Create tables for each summary stat\n\ncrime_type_table &lt;- crime_type |&gt;\n  # Create percentage variable\n  mutate(pct = count / sum(count)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    # Add commas for count, % symbols for percentage (rounded)\n    count = comma(count),\n    pct   = percent(pct, accuracy = 0.01)\n  ) |&gt;\n  # Select top 10 most common crimes by type\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\ncrime_tod_table &lt;- crime_tod |&gt;\n  mutate(pct = count / sum(count)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    count = comma(count),\n    pct   = percent(pct, accuracy = 0.01)\n  )\n\n# Display summary statistics using kable()\nkable(\n  crime_type_table,\n  col.names = c(\"Crime type\", \"Count\", \"Percent\"),\n  caption = \"Crime incidents by Type\"\n)\n\n\nCrime incidents by Type\n\n\nCrime type\nCount\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nThefts\n28,206\n23.91%\n\n\nOther Assaults\n20,323\n17.23%\n\n\nAll Other Offenses\n12,796\n10.85%\n\n\nMotor Vehicle Theft\n11,542\n9.78%\n\n\nVandalism/Criminal Mischief\n9,841\n8.34%\n\n\nTheft from Vehicle\n7,521\n6.37%\n\n\nFraud\n7,161\n6.07%\n\n\nAggravated Assault No Firearm\n4,170\n3.53%\n\n\nBurglary Residential\n2,429\n2.06%\n\n\nNarcotic / Drug Law Violations\n1,875\n1.59%\n\n\n\n\nkable(\n  crime_tod_table,\n  col.names = c(\"Time of day\", \"Count\", \"Percent\"),\n  caption = \"Crime incidents by Time of Day\"\n)\n\n\nCrime incidents by Time of Day\n\n\nTime of day\nCount\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nafternoon\n42,762\n36.24%\n\n\nmorning\n33,324\n28.24%\n\n\nevening\n29,275\n24.81%\n\n\nnight\n12,623\n10.70%\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis:\n\nThe datasets used were crime incidents, Park and Rec Program (PPR) sites, and street lights.These datasets were selected to conduct crime analysis at the tract level in Philadelphia. Our goal was to see if tracts with greater street light densities and access to nearby PPR sites experienced lower crime levels.\nThe data source for all of our datasets came from from openphilly.org. Crime incidents are from 2025, and PPR sites are from 2022. There is no date associated with the street lights dataset.\nDataset Features:\n\nCrime incidents: 14 features\nPPR programs: 11 features\nStreet lights: 17 features\n\nThe CRS for the data was in WGS 84. I changed it to a projected CRS such as StatePlane PA South that is more locally accurate for area and distance calculations with low distortion levels.\nWe calculated count and percentage statistics from the crimes dataset, grouping by type of crime and time of day.\n\n\n\nPose a research question\n\nIn Philadelphia, do census tracts with worse access to recreation centers and fewer street lights experience higher evening / night time crime rates?\n\n\nConduct spatial analysis\n\nUse at least TWO spatial operations to answer your research question.\nRequired operations (choose 2+):\n\nBuffers\nSpatial joins\nSpatial filtering with predicates\nDistance calculations\nIntersections or unions\nPoint-in-polygon aggregation\n\n\n# Step 1a: Filter crime for only evening + night crimes for street lights analysis\ncrime_en &lt;- crime |&gt;\n  filter(time_of_day %in% c(\"evening\", \"night\"))\n\n# Step 1b: Filter crime for only morning + afternoon crimes for PPR sites analysis\ncrime_am &lt;- crime |&gt;\n  filter(time_of_day %in% c(\"morning\", \"afternoon\"))\n\n# Step 2: Spatial Join - crime, lights with census tracts\ncrime_tracts_en &lt;- st_join(crime_en, phl_tracts, join = st_within)\ncrime_tracts_am &lt;- st_join(crime_am, phl_tracts, join = st_within)\nlight_tracts &lt;- st_join(lights, phl_tracts, join = st_within)\n\n# Step 3: Calculate total number of crimes and street lights per tract\ncrime_count_en &lt;- crime_tracts_en |&gt;\n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(GEOID)) |&gt;\n  group_by(GEOID) |&gt;\n  summarise(crime_count_en = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\ncrime_count_am &lt;- crime_tracts_am |&gt;\n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(GEOID)) |&gt;\n  group_by(GEOID) |&gt;\n  summarise(crime_count_am = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nlights_count &lt;- light_tracts |&gt;\n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(GEOID)) |&gt;\n  group_by(GEOID) |&gt;\n  summarise(lights_count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Step 4: Calculate distance to nearest ppr site for each tract centroid\n\n# Calculate tract centroids\ntr_centroids &lt;- st_centroid(phl_tracts)\n\n# Create distance matrix between centroids & ppr sites\ndist_to_ppr &lt;- st_distance(tr_centroids, ppr_sites)\n\n# Find closest ppr site to each centroid\nmin_dist_to_ppr &lt;- apply(dist_to_ppr, 1, min)\n\nphl_tracts_dist_ppr &lt;- phl_tracts |&gt;\n  st_drop_geometry() |&gt;\n  #

Even by seperating the data to analyze morning/afternoon crimes with PPR sites and evening/night crimes with PPR sites, there are not significant discoveries or trends to be made from plots and tables alone. From the choropleth of crime-heavy tracts, it does look like these tracts do cluster near eachother, signifying they belong to unsafe neighborhoods. Additionally, from the tables, tracts that experience high crime levels in the morning/afternoon tend to have higher crime levels in the evening/night at a glance. For further research, I think it would be beneficial to do zip code level analysis to get a better sense of patterns in crime throughout Philadelphia in larger geographic regions than at the tract level. I also think it could be valuable to normalize crime counts into rates using population data and street light counts into densities with area data. However, it may be the case that these variables are not strong indicators or predictors of crime level throughout the city. For that, we could do correlation, regression analyses among others to delve deeper into the factors that cause high crime, which can benefit policymakers in their decision-making."

It is extremely important to understand our data and recognize flaws in algorithms that can perpetuate bias, which usually harm marginalized groups of people.\nThe Census data provides valuable information (ACS) for us to analyze with data-driven methods in formulating policies that solve problems in bettering communities."

    "text": "Reflection\n\nI had not had a formal introduction to Census data before. Sometimes, working with assigned datasets in class overlook a key aspect being data collection, which is a key decision in framing an analytics problem with human choice.\nI think that it is very valuable to go over biases in algorithms and data. One saying that I was taught is “Data is never neutral”, highlighting that there are many subjective human decisions that go into creating data-driven solutions. It is crucial that we recognize these risks in our problem-solving process to mitigate risk of biases in our policy decisions to protect at-risk groups of people."
