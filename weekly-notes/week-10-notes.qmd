## Key Concepts Learned
- Panel Data: Data that follows the same units over multiple time periods.
- Space-Time Interaction: Different patterns by location and time!
- Bin (uniform time intervals) the data: Aggregate or find patterns at second-level since each observation has unique timestamp.
  - Smaller bins = more sparse data
- Time features: rush hour, weekend, holidays, etc.
- Temporal lags: Past demand predicts future demand.
  - 1 hour: short term persistence
  - 3 hour: medium term trend (morning rush)
  - 12 hour: half-day cycle: am vs pm
  - 24 hour: Daily periodicity
- Train on early months/hours etc, then test on later ones



## Coding Techniques
- Extract time features: week, wday, hour, floor_date
- Create lag variable: lag(var, lag_num)
- Ensure every hour bin exists: expand.grid()


## Questions & Challenges
- None!

## Connections to Policy
