## Key Concepts Learned
- EDA: 
  - Create summary statistics table
    - But can hide underlying data distribution
      - Outliers, non-linear relationships
    - So data visualization is important
    - Can have same mean, var, cov, regression but diff patterns in visualization
  - Bad / Misleading data visualizations
    - Misleading scales or axes
    - Cherry-picked time periods
    - Hidden or ignored uncertainty
    - Missing context about data reliability
    - Result: Poor policy decisions
  - Goal: Understand your data before making decisions or building models
    - What does the data look like? (distributions, missing values)
    - What patterns exist? (relationships, clusters, trends)
    - Whatâ€™s unusual? (outliers, anomalies, data quality issues)
    - What questions does this raise? (hypotheses for further investigation)
    - How reliable is this data?
  - Workflow w/ Data Quality Focus: Enhanced process for policy analysis
    - Load and inspect - dimensions, variable types, missing data
    - Assess reliability - examine margins of error, calculate coefficients of variation
    - Visualize distributions - histograms, boxplots for each variable
    - Explore relationships - scatter plots, correlations
    - Identify patterns - grouping, clustering, geographical patterns
    - Question anomalies - investigate outliers and unusual patterns
    - Document limitations - prepare honest communication about data quality
  - JOINS - join predicate does not need to be same name, NEED SAME TYPE
    - left (most-common) / right: keeps everything from left/right
    - full: keeps everything from both columns
    - inner: keeps only matches
    

## Coding Techniques
- ggplot2
  - Data -> Aesthetics -> Geometry -> Visual
    - Data: Your dataset (census data, survey responses, etc.)
    - Aesthetics: What variables map to visual properties (x, y, color, size)
    - Geometries: How to display the data (points, bars, lines)
    - Additional layers: Scales, themes, facets, annotations
    - General syntax: ggplot(data = your_data) +   aes(x = variable1, y = variable2) +   geom_something() +   additional_layers()
  - Aesthetic Mappings: maps data to visual properties
    - x, y - position
    - color - point/line color
    - fill - area fill color
    - size - point/line size
    - shape - point shape
    - alpha - transparency
  - str_detect(), str_extract(), regex() to search within strings
